# Landing Page Plan: ForkSpotting - Bird Watching for Repos

## Design Concept
A landing page themed around "bird watching" but for GitHub repository forks. The metaphor: developers are like bird watchers, spotting interesting forks in the wild. Clean, modern, playful but professional.

## Visual Direction
- **Color Palette**: Use existing slate/zinc theme with accent colors for "bird" elements
- **Typography**: Geist Sans (already configured)
- **Icons**: Lucide icons (GitBranch, GitFork, Bird, Eye, Telescope, etc.)
- **Style**: Minimal, lots of whitespace, subtle animations, gradient accents

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section
- Large, centered layout with generous padding
- Main headline: "Spot forks in the wild"
- Subheadline about discovering interesting GitHub forks
- Two CTAs: "Start Watching" (primary) and "How it Works" (secondary/outline)
- Decorative bird/fork illustrations using icons

### 2. Features Grid (3 cards)
- **Track Nesting**: Follow your favorite repos and their forks
- **Spot Rare Species**: Discover interesting forks before they blow up
- **Migration Patterns**: See how projects evolve across the ecosystem

### 3. How It Works (3 steps)
1. Enter a GitHub username
2. Explore their repos and forks
3. Discover interesting contributions

### 4. Social Proof / Stats
- X+ repos tracked
- X+ forks discovered
- X+ developers watching

### 5. Final CTA Section
- Large CTA card with primary button linking to /github
- Tagline: "Start your fork watching journey"

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify
- `/home/flagmate/programming/fork-watcher/src/app/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite

### Components to Use from src/components/ui/
- `Button` - Primary and outline variants for CTAs
- `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent` - Feature cards
- `Badge` - For tags and labels

### Icons to Import
From lucide-react:
- `GitBranch`, `GitFork`, `Github` - GitHub/repo related
- `Eye`, `Telescope`, `Search` - Bird watching metaphor
- `ArrowRight` - CTA arrows
- `Sparkles` - Accent decoration

### Layout Approach
- Full-width sections with max-w-7xl container
- Responsive grid for features (1 col mobile, 3 col desktop)
- Centered text alignment for hero
- Dark mode support via existing theme

### Animation Ideas
- Subtle hover effects on cards
- Button hover states
- Icon pulse/scale on hover
- Gradient text for headline

## Content

### Headline
"Spot forks in the wild"

### Subheadline
"Like bird watching, but for code. Discover interesting GitHub forks, track how projects evolve, and find hidden gems in the open source ecosystem."

### Features
1. **Track Nesting Sites** - Follow your favorite repositories and watch their forks grow in real-time
2. **Spot Rare Species** - Discover unique forks and contributions before they become mainstream
3. **Study Migration Patterns** - Understand how ideas flow through the open source ecosystem

### CTA
"Start Your Fork Watching Journey"

## Verification
- Page renders correctly in both light and dark modes
- All links work (especially the CTA to /github)
- Responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Uses only existing UI components
- No duplication of github page functionality
